# About this project

[Link to the website of this project.](http://www.gusinhoadesivos.com.br)

This project was made for a car wrapping company.

I did not have a pre-made design for the website, I was creating while I was programming, taking inspiration from other websites. The goal of this projects was not the design, but to improve my HTML, CSS and Javascript skills.
